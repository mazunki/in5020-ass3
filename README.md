# IN5020 - Chord Protocol (ass 3)

To run the application explicitly, you can use the following examples. Default values for the variables is 10, and aren't necessary.

```sh
make clean all
make run NODE_COUNT=10 BIT_LENGTH=10
make run NODE_COUNT=100 BIT_LENGTH=20
make run NODE_COUNT=1000 BIT_LENGTH=20
```

You can also just `make cleansim` to build the log files.
